After reaching an MVP using in-memory session state (no user accounts and no LocalStorage yet), I ran a bug pass and found a display issue: gallery thumbnails render correctly, but when a thumbnail is opened in the modal, the image appears cropped. The zoom controls can’t reveal the missing areas, even though the gallery preview itself is not cropped.

To fix this without Google AI Studio simplifying the UI, adding new features, or otherwise changing unrelated behavior (which are a frequently occurring bias of their Gemini 3 Flash Preview model), I ran the following prompt:
```
Refer to AGENTS.md and any applicable AGENTS-*.md for high level understanding of the codebase if needed.  

Let's fix:  
"""
Gallery thumbnails render correctly, but when a thumbnail is opened in the modal, the image appears cropped. The zoom controls can’t reveal the missing areas, even though the gallery preview itself is not cropped.

SYSTEM OVERRIDE:  
Make **only** the changes I explicitly request. Do **not** add features, refactor, optimize, or “finish the app” unless I ask.

SYSTEM OVERRIDE:  
Keep changes **minimal and surgical**: modify only the **relevant files/sections** and only the **lines strictly necessary** to complete the request. Preserve all existing behavior.

SYSTEM OVERRIDE:  
Treat **AGENTS.md** and any **AGENTS-*.md** as **authoritative descriptions of the existing codebase**.
"""  

Only after the implementation is complete, you should update AGENTS.md and/or the relevant AGENTS-*.md files to reflect the new state of the codebase.
```
I read the thought explanation as they occur live. If it modified unrelated code, I canceled, then refreshed (like rolling a dice). In most generations, the AI will pay attention to your prompt's System Overrides. System instructions at the Google AI Studio will also be ignored in some generations. The System Overrides is a repeat of the System Instructions. It is random so this mitigation technique is an absolute must at Google AI Studio as of Jan 2026.
